Minty's box of kitties is planned to be a mod that adds a bunch of NPCs for my own entertainment and not much else. You might also enjoy it.

Possible future features:
-Some NPCs
 -A catgirl and her friends
-Some equipment items
-Some pylons
 -A special pylon for the NPCs (compare Sibling Pylon from Fargo's Mod)
 -Versatile Pylon (Universal Pylon but you still need to build a town around it)
 -Esoteric Pylon (a pylon for places which have no pylon of their own)
-Some boss fights
 -Use Evil Nip to summon...?

Current features:
